## Summary  
* I am designing a learning application called "Citizen's Journey" to encourage users to participate in public affairs critically. The website includes three pages, aiming to help users go through a thinking and research process before they make decisions in voting. If we do not make a research or engage in any kinds of discussion before we vote, we tend to be influenced by others or trust biased media sources easily without making their own judgement.


* The first page is for users to create their customized profile. Users can also customized the profile color based on their mood.
The second page is a checklist to remind users of conducting research before they vote.
The third page is an interactive referendum questions forum for discussion, vote, and express their thoughts.


* I have tried to practice all the basic Vue.js concepts our class has covered during the previous 6 weeks to deepen my understanding of vue basics.
Page1: Create a custom user profile(form, v-model, v-if/else, v-show, change background color, method, computed ...)
Page2: Checklist (data flow, emit& props concepts, custom component, method, computed…)
Page3:  Voting Referendum: discussion forum (data flow, emit& props concepts, how various components pass in data to one another...)
