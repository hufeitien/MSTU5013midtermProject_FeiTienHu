## Summary  
* I am designing a learning application called "Citizen's Journey" to encourage users to participate in public affairs critically. The website includes three pages, aiming to help users go through a thinking and research process before they make decisions in voting. If we do not make a research or engage in any kinds of discussion before we vote, we tend to be influenced by others or trust biased media sources easily without our own judgement.

The first page is for users to create their customized profile. Users can also customized the profile color based on their mood.
The second page is a checklist to remind users of conducting research before they vote.
The third page is an interactive referendum questions forum for discussion, vote, and express their thoghts.


## Inspiration
My lovely hometown Taiwan(2018 Taiwanese referendum) and my personal experiences as a citizen.
